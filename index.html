                        Hey there! I know before starting anything, one is required to give some introductions but still I chose to present a disclaimer first. Why? Because I love you and want you to be prepared to read some dope shit. I ain't any writer but I guess I still can connect some words to make grammatically correct sentences. Moreover, in this digital age who needs a Oxford Degree to be a writer. I know you spotted an error but keep it to yourself. No one is giving you any marks for it.

                        Hello again! If you are still here(must be an adamant human). I am Sidharth Anand and the picture that you are seeing on right, yeah that same pic is not mine. I mean I do feel sorry for him that he couldn't get my face but its all destined atleast that's what many say in India. But since I'm such a good fellow with a golden heart, I'm happy to trade faces because I love helping people.

                        This guide assumes you have the following basic understanding: 
                        <ul class="li-contents">
                            <li>This is a guide that'll guide you about nothing.</li>
                            <li>It's a fun exercise aimed at making you laugh (if you don't laugh then your taste is at fault not my writing).</li>
                            <li>If you're still here seeking some guide then you absolutely need a GUIDE my friend.</li>

                        Well, that's a good question. You deserve to know why you are wasting your time to read this. It's a technical documentation project to be submitted on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freecodecamp</a> (I'm sure you're already familiar with this website). I thought maybe I can get into the technicalities of my little brain and document it. It may not be perfect but its worth a try (remembering some quote I read somewhere).

                        Alright, since you stayed with me till this point then we atleast deserve to be friends (this logic won't work in case you skipped to this part using the navbar). So, I'll share with you my little secret. I stole the website color scheme from <a href="https://developer.mdn.com" target="_blank">MDN's new look</a> and the entire website design structure was copied from <a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL" target="_blank">freecodecamp's codepen.</a> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope my secrets are safe with you. GoodBye 👋
