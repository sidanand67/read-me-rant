                        Hey there! I know before starting anything, one is required to give some introductions but still I chose to present a disclaimer first. Why? Because I love you and want you to be prepared to read some dope shit. I ain't any writer but I guess I still can connect some words to make grammatically correct sentences. Moreover, in this digital age who needs a Oxford Degree to be a writer. I know you spotted an error but keep it to yourself. No one is giving you any marks for it 😏

                        Hello again! If you are still here(must be an adamant human). I am <strong>Sidharth Anand</strong> and the picture that you are seeing on right, yeah that same pic is not mine. I mean I do feel sorry for him that he couldn't get my face but its all destined atleast that's what many say in India. But since I'm such a good fellow with a golden heart, I'm happy to trade faces because I love helping people.

                        Well, that's a good question. You deserve to know why you are wasting your time to read this. It's a technical documentation project to be submitted on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freecodecamp</a> (I'm sure you're already familiar with this website). I thought maybe I can get into the technicalities of my little brain and document it. It may not be perfect but its worth a try (remembering some quote I read somewhere).

                    <p>
                        <strong>Code</strong> is some esoteric concept that even I can't explain. Seriously, I am not here to teach you. I can't believe you thought I'll even define it. But I'm sure as hell going to flex my not so great programming skills. 
                        Let me start with python:  
                    </p>
                    <p class="code">
                        <code>name,age = "Sidharth",24</code>
                        <code>print(f"My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old.")</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please tell me how impressed you are. I intentionally chose to write something that'll baffle your soul. How about I write the same code in C++. Do you wanna see how complex things can get? 
                    </p>
                    <p class="code">
                        <code>#include &LeftAngleBracket;iostream&RightAngleBracket;</code>
                        <code>using namespace std;</code>
                        <code>int main(){</code>
                        <code>&emsp;    &ensp;int age = 24;</code>
                        <code>&emsp;    &ensp;string name = "Sidharth";</code>
                        <code>&emsp;    &ensp;cout<<"My name is "<< name <<" and I'm " << age <<" years old.";</code>
                        <code>&emsp;    &ensp;return 0;</code>
                        <code>}</code>

                <article>
                    <p>
                        I know you are confused as hell as to WTF is <strong>Gibberish Code</strong>. Well, guess what I just invented this term right now and this can be defined as the following:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>A code that sucks is called Gibberish Code.</p>
                    </blockquote> 
                    <p>
                        We are all being told about the importance of clean code and how it improves the readability & increases the understanding of the code. But you can't expect a beginner to code clean and you can't even demotivate or demoralize them for coding shit. Personally I would suggest you all to code gibberish till you get a hang of it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now enough talking and let's take a look at what gibberish code looks like. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="code">
                        <code>let a = 24; console.log(a);</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Truth be told, above code doesn't make any sense. It could either be my age or room temperature or the numerous things that you & me can think of. The lack of clarity that it offers is the foundation of writing gibberish code. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope we are the on the same page now. 
                    </p>

                    Clean Code

                    <p>
                        Since we are talking about gibberish code, I guess it wouldn't fair if we don't bring <strong>Clean Code</strong> into the picture. Let's start with defining it. 
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>A code that makes sense is called Clean Code.</p>
                    </blockquote> 
                    <p>
                        I mean life is already so complex that we even want to clean our code to make some sense of it. I've seen people with clean codes as confused as the ones with gibberish code. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's take a look at what clean offers
                    </p>
                    <p class="code">
                        <code>let age = 24;</code> 
                        <code>console.log(age);</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ok. Now, you know I'm talking about my age but don't you think there's no more suspense left to this code. It's so clear that I won't even bother looking it again. Do you really want this to happen with your codes? Do you want people to never look back again? Is this what you spend your hours for? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These are some serious questions and you definitely should think about it.  
                    </p>

                    Hello World
                </header>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        How can I even forget this? You are not coder or programmer or whatever you wanna call yourself until and unless you've not coded a <strong>Hello World</strong> program. For those who don't know, let me give you an example after all I've to add 5 code elements in this project. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="code">
                        <code>console.log("Hello World!");</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But I still don't understand why are we talking to the world when in fact we are just talking to our computer. We could have started with something like the following and things would still be as good as it is now or maybe even better, who knows.
                    </p>
                    <p class="code">
                        <code>console.log("Hello Computer");</code>

                        You know we don't really respect HTML and someone who codes in HTML is not even considered a coder. HTML is so poor that it can't even stand alone without the support of CSS. CSS is another language that's known to frighten many (me too). Every time feels the first time. Anyways, let's keep CSS for some other day and focus only on HTML. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But there are some things about HTML that make it very attractive and they are:-
                        <ul class="li-contents">
                            <li>Always producing some output.</li>
                            <li>Never throwing errors.</li>
                            <li>And many more that I can't think of.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                        I've written enough. Seriously this would be my first time when I wrote something so long by myself without any compulsions. Oh God, let me give a pat on my back. Such achievements are very rare when I actually sit down to accomplish something.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think you can leave now or can even share this dope shit with your coder friends if you want to. I mean I'll appreciate it but it's totally upto you. <strong>No forcing from my side.</strong>

So, I'll share with you my little secret. I stole the website color scheme from <a href="https://developer.mdn.com" target="_blank">MDN's new look</a> and the entire website design structure was copied from <a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL" target="_blank">freecodecamp's codepen.</a>
